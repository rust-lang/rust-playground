# Hello, and thanks for looking into the Tari Rustpen's security!
#
# This build is running on an unprivileged, sandboxed Docker container with no
# network access, so while you can technically run arbitrary code on the
# Rustpen you shouldn't be able to do any damage with it.
#
# Nothing is perfect though: if you find a way to escape the sandbox, please
# disclose it following our security policy! You can find the policy at:
#
#    https://github.com/tari-project/tari/blob/development/SECURITY.md
