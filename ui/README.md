## Configuration

When developing, you can place these in a [`.env`][dotenv] file on
disk in this directory.

In production, these should be set according to your deployment method
of choice.

### Troubleshooting

#### macOS

After launching `ui`, when you try to do any action (ex. `build`, `rustfmt`, `run` and so on), you get errors from Docker about "Mounts denied":

```
docker: Error response from daemon: Mounts denied:
The paths /var/folders/dx/l5pn75zx5v9_cwstvgwc5qyc0000gn/T/playground.6gEHdGUM6XPU/output and /var/folders/dx/l5pn75zx5v9_cwstvgwc5qyc0000gn/T/playground.6gEHdGUM6XPU/input.rs
are not shared from OS X and are not known to Docker.
You can configure shared paths from Docker -> Preferences... -> File Sharing.
See https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/#namespaces for more info.
.
time="2099-12-31T00:00:00+00:00" level=error msg="error waiting for container: context canceled"
```

To fix this issue, set the `TMPDIR` environment variable to a path that Docker can mount:

```
mkdir tmp
TMPDIR=$PWD/tmp cargo run
```
